# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using clinical patient data. The goal is to demonstrate how data science and predictive modeling can assist in early detection and healthcare decision‑making.

The project covers the full data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-project.git
cd heart-disease-project
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🧠 Model Training

The project experiments with several classification algorithms such as:

* Logistic Regression
* KNeighbor Classifier
* Random Forest

Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
---

## 📈 Results

* Best model: **LogisticRegression**

Visualizations help interpret feature importance and model performance.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Adding more datasets for improved generalization
* Implementing deep learning approaches
